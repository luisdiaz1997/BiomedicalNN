## Instalation
Install anaconda 3 in your system
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Then create new environment

```
conda create --name fast python=3.6
```

Activate the environment
```
conda activate fast
```

Then install packages
```
conda install pytorch=1.4 torchvision -c pytorch
conda install -c fastai fastai
conda install flask gunicorn
```
---------------------------------------
## Test run

```
python model.py sample/NORMAL2-IM-0832-0001-0002.jpeg
python model.py sample/person469_bacteria_1993.jpeg
```
That should create files with same name in ./predictions
They will contain a green title with the prediction
model.py just takes the path of an image as argument
this path can be anywhere in the computer
---------------------------------------
## Changing the paths
You can change the paths of where the model is located
And where the predictions will be sent
by changing the following in model.py

```
model_path = 'models/'
output_path = 'predictions/'
```

make sure that the path of the models
always contains the file "dense"

---------------------------------------
## Run server

```
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 wsgi:app
```
